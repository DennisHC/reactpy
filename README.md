Temporary branch being used to rewrite ReactPy's documentation.

Many of these pages are in progress, and are using the [original ReactJS docs](https://react.dev/learn) as placeholders.

See live preview here: https://reactive-python.github.io/reactpy

In order to set up an environment to develop these docs...

1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.9 or higher
2. Fork and clone this repository
3. _Optional_: Create a Python virtual environment with the following command: `python3 -m venv venv`
4. _Optional_: Activate the virtual environment (this method will vary based on operating system)
5. Install the dependencies with the following command: `pip install -r docs/requirements.txt`
6. Run the following command: `mkdocs serve`
7. Follow the on-screen prompts to view the documentation in your browser
8. You can now edit the markdown files located within `docs/src/` and see the changes in real time
